# star-technology
One of the first 1.19.2 GregTech modpacks having as an end goal making stargates.

Star Technology Hard-Mode is a Unofficial fork of Star Technology with the goal of being as bombastic with progression as possible.
This means that barely any considerations are made for the player, and mostly added to give the player busy work.

Currently in development.
